### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**My name is Aman Obaid** I am a passionate AI Engineer & Application Developer with hands-on experience in building AI-driven systems, intelligent agents, and scalable applications. My work spans from Flutter-based cross-platform apps to cutting-edge AI solutions integrating LangGraph-based agents, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), vector databases, and FastAPI backends



- ðŸ”­ **Currently working on:**

 -AI Agents & Orchestration: Building LangGraph-based multi-tool AI agents with memory and RAG.
 -Backend Development: Designing FastAPI-based, production-ready APIs with context caching and vector-based retrieval.
 -AI-powered Applications: Deploying intelligent, autonomous systems for search, e-commerce, and productivity use cases.

 - **Currently Learning**

  -Advanced AI/ML concepts (LLMs, embeddings, vector search, memory-augmented systems).
  -Blockchain & Smart Contract Security for AI-integrated DeFi solutions.
  -Scalable SaaS architecture and observability for AI pipelines

  
- ðŸ‘¯ **Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:**

  -Generative AI applications leveraging LLMs, RAG, and autonomous agent frameworks.
  -AI + Web3 projects that push the frontier of decentralized, secure, and intelligent systems.
  -Full-stack AI-powered apps combining frontend (Flutter/React) and backend (Python/FastAPI).
